# Guess My Number
#
# The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
# The player tries to guess it and the computer lets
# the player know if the guess is too high, too low or right on the money.
# Assignment: Modify the Guess My Number program so that the player
# has a limited number of guesses. If the player fails to guess in time,
# the program should display an appropriately chastising message
